# Cards Gateway Example

> Under Heavy Development

## Install

```bash
# The script will install everything necessary
./transfer_gateway setup
```

## Running

```bash
# The script will start everything
./transfer_gateway start
```

## Stop

```bash
# The script will stop all services
./transfer_gateway stop
```

## Issues

* Loom provider should be installed from `yarn link`
* Loom-JS should be the latest (probably still a Pull Request) also should be via `yarn link`
* Requires latest `loom` binary (under heavy development too)
