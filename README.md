# Cards Gateway Example

Example of how to use Transfer Gateway from Loom DAppChain to transfer assets (ERC721 tokens) to
Ethereum network and to transfer assets (ERC721 tokens) to DAppChain.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

* node >= 8
* wget (used to download Loom DAppChain binary)
* nc (used to check available ports before run loom, ganache or webpack)

> wget and nc can be found on command `transfer_gateway` which is a shell script
> to help put all necessary services together

### Install

Clone this repository

```bash
# Install necessary packages node_packages and loom binary
./transfer_gateway setup
```

### Running

```bash
# Start services ganache, loom and web interface and mapping configuration
./transfer_gateway start
```

### Stop

```bash
# Stop all services (loom, ganache and webserver)
./transfer_gateway stop
```

### Status

```bash
# Check status of services
./transfer_gateway status
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Remove downloaded packages node_modules and loom binary
./transfer_gateway cleanup
```

### Web Browser

After execute `./transfer_gateway start` and starts the necessary services, you can access the web interface on `localhost:8080`

### MetaMask

This example requires `MetaMask` to be installed and configured to use the `Private Network` on `localhost:8545`, also the imported account should be `0x5194b63f10691e46635b27925100cfc0a5ceca62`, which has the private key `0xbb63b692f9d8f21f0b978b596dc2b8611899f053d68aec6c1c20d1df4f5b6ee2` (those keys are just used here we don't use anywhere else).

How to config.

> After the second restart of the example it's possible that a transaction to DAppChain will fail an error like "rpc error with payload {‚Ä¶nonce. account has nonce of: 0 tx has nonce of: 5", it's because of the MetaMask nonce counter that needed to reset. Go to MetaMask -> Settings -> Reset Account, it should restart the nonce counter on MetaMask


## Example "in a nutshell"

The `cards-gateway-example` directory is divided by five sub directories, each directory has important role:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dappchain
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ truffle-ethereum
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ truffle-dappchain
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transfer-gateway-scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webclient
```

### üìÅ dappchain

This directory contains the `loom` binary (after setup), also a `genesis.example.json` and some private and public keys.

> Those keys are pre created in order to make the sample easier to start, also they are already used on configurations.

Continuing, let's take a loom o file `loom.yaml`, this file is not new, but it has new parameters, so let's take a look:

#### loom.yaml

```yaml
# This is the new configuration
TransferGateway:
  # Important to keep the indentation

  # Enables the Transfer Gateway Go contract, must be the same on all nodes.
  ContractEnabled: true
  # Enables the in-process Transfer Gateway Oracle.
  OracleEnabled: true

  # Address of the Ethereum node, the node should have the JSON RPC available and running
  EthereumURI: "http://127.0.0.1:8545"

  # Address of the Gateway deploy on address above (EthereumURI)
  MainnetContractHexAddress: "0xf5cad0db6415a71a5bc67403c87b56b629b4ddaa"

  # Private key of the Ethereum validator used to sign the valid transfers between Ethereum and DAppChain
  MainnetPrivateKeyPath: "oracle_eth_priv.key"

  # Private key of the Oracle
  DAppChainPrivateKeyPath: "oracle_priv.key"

  # Address of DAppChain consulted by the Oracle
  DAppChainReadURI: "http://localhost:46658/query"
  DAppChainWriteURI: "http://localhost:46658/rpc"

  # These control how often the Oracle will poll the blockchains for events.
  DAppChainPollInterval: 1 # seconds
  MainnetPollInterval: 1 # seconds

  # Number of seconds to wait before starting the Oracle.
  OracleStartupDelay: 5
  # Number of seconds to wait between reconnection attempts.
  OracleReconnectInterval: 5
```

And finally the `genesis.json`, with `AddressMapper` plugin a new plugin that will be responsible for "map" addresses from Ethereum and DAppChain and `Gateway` is the plugin that manages transfers from between Ethereum and DAppChain, all transfer are secure and signed. This plugin also manages the Oracles, which are responsible for pool information from Ethereum network and sign withdraws from DAppChain to Ethereum network.

```json
{
    [
        {
            "vm": "plugin",
            "format": "plugin",
            "name": "addressmapper",
            "location": "addressmapper:0.1.0",
            "init": null
        },
        {
            "vm": "plugin",
            "format": "plugin",
            "name": "gateway",
            "location": "gateway:0.1.0",
            "init": {
                "owner": {
                    "chain_id": "default",
                    "local": "c/IFoEFkm4+D3wdqLmFU9F3t3Sk="
                },
                "oracles": [
                    {
                        "chain_id": "default",
                        "local": "22nuyPPZ53/qAqFnhwD2EpNu9ss="
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### üìÅ truffle-ethereum

This directory contains the contracts that will be deployed on the Ethereum network, the `Gateway` and `CryptoCards` the ERC721 token representation on the Ethereum network.

The act of depositing `CryptoCards` on `Gateway` is the one of the main features on this ERC721 token, let's look on the function.

```sol
function depositToGateway(uint tokenId) public {
  safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, gateway, tokenId);
}
```

This function once called along with the `tokenId` will also call the `safeTransferFrom` which will call the function `onERC721Received` on contract `Gateway` which will register the owner of the token.

Another important function is the `withdrawERC721` on `Gateway`, called once the user wants to withdraw the token from `DAppChain` and get back the fully ownership of the token.

> The withdraw process only happen with a secure sign guaranteed by the validators of the network, no one unless the owner of the token can withdraw from DAppChain

### üìÅ truffle-dappchain

This directory contains the representation of the `CryptoCards` from `truffle-ethereum` on the `DAppChain`, is a exact "mirroring" of the ERC721 tokens from Ethereum network, but now living inside the `Loom DAppChain`.

When the user deposits his/her tokens `CryptoCards` on the Ethereum network into the contract `Gateway` the `TransferGateway` will pool that information and `mint` a representation (mirror).

On the `CryptoCardsDAppChain` contract there's a `mint` only available for the authorized `TransferGateway`

```sol
function mint(uint256 _uid) public {
  require(msg.sender == gateway);
  _mint(gateway, _uid);
}
```

### üìÅ transfer-gateway-scripts

Containing only one script `index.js` which will be responsible for map the `CryptoCards` on Ethereum network and the `CryptoCardsDAppChain` on Loom DAppChain. This is an very important step to make everything work together, without this the `TransferGateway` will not know which ERC721 asset should be mirrored on DAppChain

### üìÅ webclient

Finally the web interface, which will require `MetaMask` to be installed on a compatible browser (Chrome / Firefox).

The web interface will be available on `http://localhost:8080`, just open the browser on this address and the interface will be presented. The interface has four areas.

The `Home` page which will require your `MetaMask` signature to map your Ethereum network address with DAppChain address (no one other than you can create that link).

Next areas are `Owned Cards` which are the cards owned by your user (yeah we just gave 5 cards to you üòâ), `Cards On DAppChain` cards that are deposited on `Gateway` and properly mirrored on `DAppChain` and the `Cards On Gateway` which are the cards that you and only you owns waiting to be withdrawal to your ownership again.
